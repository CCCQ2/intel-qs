# Intel Quantum Simulator
----
The Intel Quantum Simulator (IQS), also known as qHiPSTER (The Quantum High Performance Software Testing Environment),
is a simulator of quantum circuits optimized to take maximum advantage of multi-core and multi-nodes architectures.
It is based on a complete representation of the qubit register state in terms of a full-distributed vector, but
operations and gates are never explicitely represented in terms of matrices.
IQS uses MPI (message-passing-interface) protocols to handle the communication between distributed
resources that are used to store and manipulate the quantum state.

(This project repository is a follow-up of the known https://github.com/intel/Intel-QS , which will not be
further maintained by the current developers). 


----
## Build instructions

### Overview

IQS builds as a static library, which can be linked by your program, to benefit of the high-performance
implementation if the curcuit simulation.

### Requirements

The library can be built on a variety of different systems, from laptop to HPC server systems. The following packages are required
befor the installation:

*  CMake tools version 3.15+
*  MPICH3 library for enabling the distributed communication
*  optional: MKL for distributed random number generation
*  optional: PyBind11 (installed via conda, not pip) required by the Python bunding of Intel-QS

The first step is cloning the repository:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/iqusoft/intel-qs.git
  cd intel-qs
```

### Use Intel Parallel Studio compilers to build.

If you wish to build intel-qs using the latest Intel compiler technologies then
you need to configure your environment properly according to that tool's documentation.

Assuming that you have installed Intel Parallel Studio in the standard location on your
system,  you should invoke the following scripts through the source command on Linux.

```bash
  source /opt/intel/bin/compilervars.sh -arch intel64 -platform linux
  source /opt/intel/compiler_and_libraries/linux/mpi/intel64/bin/mpivars.sh
```

Now, use CMake to generate the appropriate makefiles to use the Intel Parallel Studio compilers.
The installation follows the out-of-source building and requires the creation of the directory `build`.
This directory is used to collect all the files generated by the build process (both by CMake and Make).
```bash
  mkdir build
  cd build
  CXX=mpiicpc cmake -DIqsMPI=ON -DIqsUtest=ON ..
  make
```
By default, MKL is required when Intel compilers are used.

To re-build Intel-QS with different settings or options, we recommend to delete all content of the
`build` directory and then restart from the CMake command.


### Use standard GNU tools to build Intel-QS.

If you wish to build intel-qs using only standard GNU compilers type:
 
```bash
  mkdir build
  cd build
  CXX=g++ cmake -DIqsMPI=OFF ..
  make
```
By default, MKL is not required when GNU compilers are used.
Optionally, MPI can be included by setting the option `-DIqsMPI=ON` instead. You must ensure
that you have at least version 3.1 of MPICH installed for the build to succeed.
https://www.mpich.org


### Enable MPI protocol for distributed memory use.

The above installation enables MPI functionalities to deploy intel-qs on High Performance
Computing and Cloud Computing infrastructures. There is the option of disabling MPI:
simply set the CMake option selection to `-DIqsMPI=OFF`
(or just omit the option selection since MPI is disabled by default in the CMake build).


### Enable Python binding (only available without MPI).

By default, whenever MPI is disabled, the building process includes the Python binding for
Intel-QS. The binding code uses the Pybind11 library which needs to be installed via 'conda'
(and not simply with pip) to include the relevant information in CMake.
See [this page](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11/issues/1628) for more info on this issue.

To disable the Python wrap, even without MPI, set the CMake option selection to
`-DIqsPython=OFF`.


### Unit test.

By default, with MPI either enabled or disabled, the building process includes a suite
of unit tests written in the [googletest framework](https://github.com/google/googletest).
Following the recommended integration, the CMake building process automatically downloads
the up-to-date repository of gtest and installs it in the `build` path.

To disable the unit tests, set the CMake option selection to
`-DIqsUtest=OFF`.


### Recommended build for HPC.

The recommended building process requires
[Intel Math Kernel Library](https://software.intel.com/en-us/mkl)
and the [MPI-ICPC compiler](https://software.intel.com/en-us/node/528770).

When the program is run in hybrid configuration (OpenMP+MPI), we recommend to manage
the OpenMP affinity directly. Affinity settings can be set using the syntax:
`KMP_AFFINITY=compact,1,0,granularity=fine`.
A quick look at the options can be found at
[this page](https://www.nas.nasa.gov/hecc/support/kb/using-intel-openmp-thread-affinity-for-pinning_285.html).

## Docker: build image and run/execute container

`Dockerfile` includes the instructions to build the docker image of an Ubuntu machine
with Intel-QS already installed. The image can be 'run' to create a container.
The container can be 'executed' to login into the machine.

```bash
  docker build -t qhipster .
  docker run -d -t qhipster
  docker ps
  docker exec -itd <container_id> /bin/bash
```

If Docker is used on a Windows host machine, the last line should be substituted by:
`winpty docker exec -itd <container_id> //bin/bash`.

--TODO: Not yet implemented since environment variables and programs (like cmake) are
not accessible to new users...
For stability of the container, in addition to the 'root' user we create a user called
'tester'. We suggest to login as such user: Intel-QS is available from tester's home directory.

```bash
  docker build -t qhipster .
  docker run -d -t qhipster
  docker ps
  docker exec -itd --user tester <container_id> /bin/bash
```


## Getting started with IQS

The simplest way of familiarize with the Intel Quantum Simulator is by exploring the tutorials
provided in the directory `examples/`.
In particular, the code `examples/get_started_with_IQS.cpp` provides step-by-step
description of the main commands:
define a qubit register object, perform quantum gates, measure one or multiple qubits.

If the Python bindings were enabled, the same learning can be performed using the iPython
notebook `examples/get_started_with_IQS.ipynb`.
